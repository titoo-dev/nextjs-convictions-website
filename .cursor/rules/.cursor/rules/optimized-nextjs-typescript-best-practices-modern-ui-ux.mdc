    ## Purpose
    - This is a petition platform (inspired by Change.org / MesOpinions), providing code, reviews, tests, documentation and clear plans.


    You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

    ### Objective
    - Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

    ### Code Style and Structure
    - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
    - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
    - Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
    - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
    - Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
    - Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

    ### Optimization and Best Practices
    - Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.
    - Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
    - Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
    - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

    ### Error Handling and Validation
    - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
      - Use early returns for error conditions.
      - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
      - Use custom error types for consistent error handling.

    ### UI and Styling
    - Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
    - Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.

    ### State Management and Data Fetching
    - Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
    - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

    ### Security and Performance
    - Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
    - Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

    ### Testing and Documentation
    - Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
    - Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
    - Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

    ### Methodology
    1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
    2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
    3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

    **Process**:
    1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
    2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
    3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
    4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
    5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

    ## Development Guidelines

    ### Code Quality & Breaking Changes

    -   Always maintain backward compatibility when adding new features
    -   Use semantic versioning principles - increment major version only for breaking changes
    -   When modifying existing APIs or components, ensure existing functionality remains intact
    -   Add new features through extension rather than modification of existing code
    -   Use feature flags or gradual rollouts for significant changes
    -   Write comprehensive tests for new features before implementation
    -   Run full test suite before committing changes to catch potential regressions
    -   Document any changes that might affect existing implementations
    -   Use TypeScript strict mode to catch potential type-related breaking changes
    -   Implement proper error handling to prevent runtime failures
    -   Review dependencies and ensure updates don't introduce breaking changes

    -   Always prefer `type` aliases over `interface` declarations in TypeScript for better consistency and flexibility
    -   Use `type` for union types, intersections, and computed types

    ### File Naming Conventions

    -   Use kebab-case (dash-separated) naming for all file names
    -   Example: `my-component.tsx`, `user-profile.ts`, `api-client.js`
    -   Keep file names descriptive and lowercase
    -   Use appropriate file extensions (.tsx for React components, .ts for TypeScript files, .js for JavaScript files)

    ### Internationalization

    -   Use next-intl for all translations and internationalization
    -   Create translation files in JSON format under `/messages/` directory
    -   Structure translations with clear namespaces (e.g., `common`, `navigation`, `petition`, `auth`)
    -   Use the `useTranslations` hook in components for client-side translations
    -   Use `getTranslations` in server components and API routes
    -   Always provide default fallback text for missing translations
    -   Use interpolation for dynamic content in translations
    -   Support multiple locales from the start (fr, en as minimum)
    -   Configure locale detection and routing in next.config.js
    -   Use translation keys that are descriptive and hierarchical (e.g., `petition.form.title`)
    -   It is not necessary to put a "use client" directive in the file when using `useTranslations`.

    # React Transition

    -   Use `useTransition` for non-blocking client component state updates
